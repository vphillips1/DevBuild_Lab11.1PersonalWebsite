                    <p><b>What I enjoy doing on my spare time...</b></p>
                    
                    <p> In my spare time, sometimes I play basic piano and sing. I would like to practice way more to get more experienced on the piano. I really enjoy it and looking forward to 
                        learning more songs. </p>

                    <p><b>What would I love to learn how to do...</b></p>
                    <p> There are so many different things out here I would be interested in learning. I would love to learn how to play the guitar and drums. The guitar has always been one the top
                        3 instruments I always wanted to learn. I plan on purchasing a guitar very soon. I may go on youtube and take some beginner guitar lessons.

                    <p>Also, I would love to learn how to paint very well. I've seen alot of artists whose paintings are very beautiful and mind blowing. If I take a few minutes 
                        out the day and practice, I know I can get better at it. </p>

                        <p><b>What I love to cook...</b></p>
                        <P> I love to cook different types of food. 
                            My favorite food is sea food and mexican. 
                            I love to cook turkey loaded nachos and burrito bowls.
                            I enjoy cooking when I have the time. 
                            I try to come up with different ideas and try to make new dishes. 
                            Seafood is my specialty. I love to grill crab legs and bake alot of my seafood.
                            For example, I love to cook baked fish. </P>

                        <p> I really enjoy learning about different coding languages. Each day I take a couple of hours out the day and code. I really enjoy learning c#, html and css.
                            I want to learn more about front end development as well. 
                            Pursuing my career in software engineering is my goal. I went to a few workshops and I took a back end bootcamp and ever since I wanted to advance my career to become a developer.
                            I am looking to advancing my career at a great technology company. In a few years, I would like to become a software Engineer and eventually become a full stack developer. 
                            I enjoy working with others and learning from other developers.

                        <p>I grew up in Detroit, Michigan. I love my city and I am excited for all the changes that took place in downtown Detroit. I currently work for an amazing company that is in 
                            the heart of downtown.
