            <p>I am currently trying to pursue my career in computer technology. I always was fascinated with engineering. 
                I took a few mechanical engineering courses in college and ever since then, I wanted to go into engineering. 
                I took a few workshops in computer programming and that is when I realize that it would be something that I would definitely want to look into. 
                I took a few front end workshops at Grand Circus and also I took a back end workshop at Quicken Loans and that is when I was introduced to C# .Net. 
                Recently, I was a student at Grand Circus learning about C#.Net in depth. Now, I am currently in the Dev.Build program training to be an Associate Software Engineer. 
                I am passionate about software engineering and I want to continue with this career path.
