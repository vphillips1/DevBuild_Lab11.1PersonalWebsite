             <p>I have completed a few projects and submitted them to github. Please visit my github link to review all the individual projects and the group projects I have completed. 
                 My favorite individual lab I completed was the UsedCarLot. I really enjoy learning about different type of cars, so this lab was one of my favorite. I also liked the Movie lab as well.  
             </p>
            <p>Here are a few more projects that I would like to highlight. I thought the POS Terminal Project was a challenge, but I understood how to do methods much more. Please see link below. </p>

            <p>  I would also like you to review the Used CarLot lab. I had to be very creative. I had plenty of fun completing this project as well. Please click on link below.</p>
